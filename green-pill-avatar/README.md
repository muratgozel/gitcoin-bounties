## Ideation
Green pill is about focusing on living together rather than focusing on an individual power. People who preferred to take the green pill has values different than the other ones. I think we should focus on these values in this avatar set.

These values essentially are being sensitive to climate change, sustainability, building and funding public goods, being well coordinated, open communication and being hopeful about the future.

So I have added a hopeful face expression to our green pill. I also added a bow tie to make it look lovable and a bit charismatic. Above our green pill, weâ€™ll have graphics that represent our values. Green pill together with that graphic, creates a persona. Currently, there are two personas I designed, as you see below: sensitive to climate change and public goods funder.
